# Common Issues

Here are solutions to the most common problems Rhyolite users encounter:

## 404 on GitHub Pages

- **Solution:** Set the correct `site` and `base` in `astro.config.mjs`.

## CLI Not Found

- **Solution:** Make sure you’re using `pnpm create rhyolite@latest` and have Node.js v18+ and pnpm installed.

## Build Fails

- **Solution:** Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are present. Check for typos in your config files.

## Template Not Listed

- **Solution:** Run `pnpm exec create-rhyolite --list` to see all available templates. Add new templates to the correct directory and update `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
