# CI/CD & Publishing

Rhyolite uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and publishing.

## Publishing to npm

- On every new version tag, the CLI is published to npm automatically.
- See `.github/workflows/publish.yml` for details.

## Docs Deployment

- Docs are built and deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- See `.github/workflows/docs.yml` for details.

## Best Practices

- Use feature branches and PRs for all changes
- Ensure all tests and builds pass before merging

See [Contributing](./contributing) for more.
