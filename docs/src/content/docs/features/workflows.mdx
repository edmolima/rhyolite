# Real-world Workflows

Rhyolite is built for automation and real-world developer workflows. Here are some examples to help you get the most out of your toolkit:

## Example: Scaffold, Build, and Test

```sh
pnpm create rhyolite@latest my-plugin -- --plugin react
cd my-plugin
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

## Example: Add a New Template

1. Fork the repo and add your template to `packages/plugin/community/`
2. Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
3. Submit a pull request

## Example: Automate CI/CD

- Use GitHub Actions to run tests, lint, and deploy docs on every push
- See `.github/workflows/` for ready-to-use workflows
