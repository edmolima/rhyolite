# Adding Packages

Add new plugins, themes, or utilities to the Rhyolite monorepo in a few steps:

## 1. Create a New Package

- Add a new folder under `packages/` (e.g., `packages/my-new-plugin`)
- Scaffold with your preferred template or start from scratch

## 2. Update Workspace Config

- Add your new package path to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

## 3. Install & Build

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## 4. Test & Document

- Add tests and a README to your new package

## 5. (Optional) Publish

- See [Automated Publishing](../ci-cd/publishing) for details
