# Monorepo Structure

Rhyolite uses a modern pnpm monorepo for a seamless developer experience and easy extensibility.

## Layout

- `packages/create-rhyolite` — The CLI tool
- `packages/plugin` — Official plugin templates
- `packages/themes` — Official theme templates
- `packages/.../community` — Community templates

## Why a Monorepo?

- **Unified tooling** — One place for all scripts, tests, and configs
- **Easy dependency management** — Share code and lock versions
- **Faster onboarding** — One install, everything works

## Getting Started

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```
