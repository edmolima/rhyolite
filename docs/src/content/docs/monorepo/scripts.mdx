# Workspace Scripts

Rhyolite’s monorepo comes with powerful workspace scripts for building, testing, and automating your workflow.

## Common Scripts

- `pnpm build` — Build all packages
- `pnpm test` — Run all tests
- `pnpm lint` — Lint all code
- `pnpm format` — Format code with Prettier

## Filtering

Run scripts for a specific package:

```sh
pnpm --filter <package> build
```

## Custom Scripts

Add new scripts to the root `package.json` or to individual packages as needed.
