# Advanced & Customization

## Customizing Templates

- Fork any official or community template and modify as needed
- Add new scripts, dependencies, or files

## Extending the CLI

- The CLI is modular and can be extended for custom workflows
- See the source in `packages/create-rhyolite/src/`

## Monorepo Tips

- Use pnpm filters for targeted builds/tests: `pnpm --filter <pkg> ...`
- Leverage workspace scripts for automation
