# Extending Templates

Rhyolite templates are designed to be extended and customized for your unique needs.

## How to Extend a Template

1. Fork an official or community template from `packages/plugin/` or `packages/themes/`.
2. Add or modify files as needed (e.g., add new commands, change styles, update config).
3. Update the `template.json` and README to reflect your changes.

## Overriding Files

You can override any file in a template by placing a file with the same name in your project directory.

## Advanced Customization

- Add custom scripts, dependencies, or build steps
- Integrate with your own CI/CD or linting tools
