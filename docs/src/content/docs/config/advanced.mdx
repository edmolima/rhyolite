# Advanced Config

Unlock advanced features and power-user workflows in Rhyolite with these configuration options:

## Environment Variables

- `RHYO_ENV` — Set the environment (e.g., `development`, `production`)
- `DEBUG` — Enable debug output for troubleshooting

## Custom Scripts

- Add scripts to your `package.json` for custom build, test, or deploy steps

## TypeScript & Linting

- Use your own `tsconfig.json` or extend the base config for stricter typing
- Add custom ESLint/Prettier rules as needed

## Power User Tips

- Use pnpm filters for targeted builds/tests: `pnpm --filter <pkg> ...`
- Leverage workspace scripts for automation
