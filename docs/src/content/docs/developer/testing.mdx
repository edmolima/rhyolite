# Testing

Rhyolite uses modern testing tools to ensure code quality and reliability across all packages.

## How to Run Tests

Run all tests in the monorepo:

```sh
pnpm test
```

Run tests for a specific package:

```sh
pnpm --filter <package> test
```

## Writing Tests

- Use your preferred test framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest)
- Place tests in a `__tests__` or `tests/` directory
- Write clear, focused test cases

## Best Practices

- Keep tests fast and isolated
- Use CI to run tests on every PR
