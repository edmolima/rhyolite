# Docs Deployment

Rhyolite documentation is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and deployed automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. This ensures your docs are always up-to-date and accessible for users and contributors.

## How It Works

- **Build:** On every push to `main`, the docs are built using Astro’s static site generator.
- **Deploy:** The built site is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch via GitHub Actions.
- **Live Preview:** Preview your docs locally with `pnpm dev` in the `docs` folder.

## Local Development

```sh
cd docs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Continuous Deployment

The workflow file `.github/workflows/docs.yml` automates the build and deploy process. It uses [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) for reliable deployment.

**Key steps:**

1. Install dependencies
2. Build the docs
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Custom Domains

To use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file to `docs/public/` with your domain name.

## Troubleshooting

- If your docs do not update, check the Actions tab for workflow errors.
- Ensure the `site` and `base` in `astro.config.mjs` match your GitHub Pages URL.
