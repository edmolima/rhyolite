# Automated Publishing

Rhyolite automates npm publishing so you can focus on building, not manual releases.

## How It Works

- **Versioning:** Bump your package version in `package.json`.
- **Tagging:** Push a git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
- **CI/CD:** The publish workflow runs on new tags, builds the package, and publishes to npm using a secure token.

## Steps to Publish

1. Update your package version:
   ```sh
   pnpm version patch # or minor/major
   git push --follow-tags
   ```
2. CI/CD will publish to npm automatically.

## Security

- The npm token is stored as a GitHub Actions secret (`NPM_TOKEN`).
- Only trusted maintainers have publish rights.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the Actions tab for publish errors.
- Ensure your package is public and has a valid `name` and `version`.
