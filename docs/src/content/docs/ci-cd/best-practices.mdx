# CI/CD Best Practices

Follow these best practices to keep your Rhyolite project fast, reliable, and easy to maintain:

## 1. Keep Workflows Fast

- Use caching for dependencies.
- Run tests and builds in parallel where possible.

## 2. Automate Everything

- Automate tests, linting, builds, and deploys.
- Use semantic versioning and automated changelogs.

## 3. Secure Your Secrets

- Store tokens (like `NPM_TOKEN`) in GitHub Secrets.
- Never commit secrets to the repo.

## 4. Review All PRs

- Require reviews and CI passing before merging.

## 5. Monitor Deployments

- Check the Actions tab for failed jobs.
- Set up notifications for failed deploys.

## 6. Document Your Workflows

- Keep `.github/workflows/` up to date and well-commented.
