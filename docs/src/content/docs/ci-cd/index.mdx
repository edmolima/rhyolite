# CI/CD & Publishing

Rhyolite uses modern CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and publishing for both code and documentation. This ensures every change is validated and shipped with confidence.

## What’s Automated?

- **Tests:** All PRs and pushes run the full test suite.
- **Linting:** Code is linted for style and quality.
- **Builds:** Packages and docs are built in clean environments.
- **Publishing:** Releases are published to npm and docs are deployed to GitHub Pages.

## How to Use

1. Push or open a PR—CI runs automatically.
2. Merge to `main`—triggers publish and deploy workflows.
3. Check the Actions tab for status and logs.

## Customization

Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`. You can extend or tweak them for your team’s needs.
