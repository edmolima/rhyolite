# Template Authoring

Create your own plugin or theme templates to share with the Rhyolite community or use in your own projects.

## How to Author a Template

1. Start from an official or community template, or create a new folder in `packages/plugin/` or `packages/themes/`.
2. Add a `template.json` file describing your template (name, description, tags).
3. Include a README with usage instructions and examples.
4. Test your template by running the CLI with your template path.

## Sharing Your Template

- Submit a pull request to add your template to the community directory.
- Well-documented, tested templates are more likely to be featured!

## Tips

- Keep templates minimal but extensible
- Use TypeScript and strict linting for best results
